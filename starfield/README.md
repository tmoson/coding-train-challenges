# Coding Train Programming Challenge #1

This is a repo for a cljs implementation of the coding train's [Starfield in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM) challenge. This project makes use of [SneakyPeet](https://github.com/SneakyPeet)'s [p5js-cljs-starter](https://github.com/SneakyPeet/p5js-cljs-starter) to allow me to use p5js in clojurescript. I have experience with clojure, but next to none with clojurescript, so this may be rough around the edges.
